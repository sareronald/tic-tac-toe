## About this project
### **How the app works**
This project is full-stack application, using React to create the front-end user experience and Sequelize and MySQL to store data in the backend. The user (teacher) is required to Signup and Login. Once logged in they are able to create a new tic-tac-toe game and populate each of the nine squares with a description of the activity and resources/hints. The teacher is able to create and edit the activities before sharing the entire tic-tac-toe with their students. 

The tic-tac-toe app could be projected on a whiteboard for the teacher to use one of the activities as a introductory exercies or the link could be added to a Google Classroom post for the students to access the grid and complete tasks independently.
  
### **Business Context** 
Covid-19 has seen a dramatic change in the way secondary education is delivered. In 2020 teachers and students alike had to quickly transition into an online learning environment. This app is designed to provide differentiated learning experiences so that all students can achieve in this environment. Differentiation is something that all teachers do within their classroom, depending on the knowledge and ability of their students - this app allows them the ability to translate this experience online, at home or in the classroom.
